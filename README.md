Now you can play it online.

Yes, this is just a web version of my (in fact, only my idea, and the implementation is almost entirely with the help of Bing AI) previous project, but now you don’t need to download the .py file to play. 

You just need to follow the link and voila!

If you don’t know why you need it, then I’ll just copy the description from the previous project:

"
At the very least, it’s for developing typing speed.

Typing speed is the ability to quickly and accurately type text on a computer keyboard or other device. Typing can be a useful skill in the modern world where information is transmitted digitally and requires prompt processing. Typing helps save time, increase productivity, improve work quality and avoid errors. Typing also contributes to the development of memory, attention, logic and creativity.

Typing is not only a convenient tool but also a valuable resource for personal and professional growth. So no matter how useless this game may seem, it’s definitely better than your TikToks…
